# Skills and tools

> Status: target design contract.
> Last updated: 2026-07-07.

Skills and tools define model-facing capabilities. The capability system owns routing and admission; this document defines packaging and user/product semantics.

## Skills

A skill is a packaged capability with:

- instructions;
- examples;
- resources;
- optional tools or MCP bindings;
- input/output contract;
- permission requirements;
- evaluation cases;
- version metadata.

## Tools

A tool is a callable schema. Tool visibility and execution are decided by the capability system.

## Relationship

A skill may require tools, but it does not make those tools available by itself. Provider decision still controls whether a required capability can run in the current session.

## Skill lifecycle

```text
draft -> validated -> published -> activated -> deprecated -> archived
```

Activation may be scoped by user, workspace, agent, or policy.

## Compatibility

Skill updates should declare:

- instruction-only change;
- schema-compatible change;
- schema-breaking change;
- provider requirement change;
- permission change.

Provider or permission changes require stronger review.

## Discovery

Skill discovery should be progressive:

- stable small index in prompt;
- deferred loading for full instructions/resources;
- capability-aware filtering;
- deterministic ordering;
- clear diagnostics for unavailable skill dependencies.
