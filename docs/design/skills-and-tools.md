# Skills and tools

> Status: target design contract.

Skills and tools define model-facing capabilities. The capability system owns routing and admission; this document defines packaging and user/product semantics.

## Skills

A skill is a packaged capability with:

- instructions;
- examples;
- resources;
- optional tools or MCP bindings;
- input/output contract;
- permission requirements;
- evaluation cases;
- version metadata.

Skill maturity is progressive: prompt-only, structured prompt, tool-backed,
resource-backed, evaluated, then governed. A package must not claim a maturity
level unless its production discovery and activation path demonstrates it.

## Tools

A tool is a callable schema. Tool visibility and execution are decided by the capability system.

## Relationship

A skill may require tools, but it does not make those tools available by itself. Provider decision still controls whether a required capability can run in the current session.

## Skill lifecycle

```text
draft -> validated -> published -> activated -> deprecated -> archived
```

Activation may be scoped by user, workspace, agent, or policy.

The operating workflow is:

```text
author -> validate -> evaluate -> publish -> activate -> observe -> tune -> version
```

Governed skills declare their stable identity and version, required
capabilities, allowed providers, instructions/resources, input/output and
permission contracts, evaluation cases, compatibility, and rollback policy.

## Implementation constraints

- One shared owner parses manifests, resolves discovery paths, and validates
  packages. CLI, server, Web, and providers consume that owner instead of
  maintaining local loaders or compatibility-shaped copies.
- Before adding a registry, parser, provider, or lifecycle state, identify the
  current owner and production callers. A second implementation requires a real
  deployment or authority boundary, not convenience for one caller.
- A replacement migrates callers and removes the superseded implementation and
  its self-only tests in the same change. Temporary dual paths require an owner,
  expiry condition, and convergence test.
- Exported types and parser unit tests do not prove a usable skill. Tests must
  cover discovery, capability admission, activation, required tool/resource
  availability, failure diagnostics, and the user-visible outcome.
- Persistence changes require the real schema, query, transaction, migration,
  and rollback/failure path to be exercised against the supported database.

## Compatibility

Skill updates should declare:

- instruction-only change;
- schema-compatible change;
- schema-breaking change;
- provider requirement change;
- permission change.

Provider or permission changes require stronger review.

## Discovery

Skill discovery should be progressive:

- stable small index in prompt;
- deferred loading for full instructions/resources;
- capability-aware filtering;
- deterministic ordering;
- clear diagnostics for unavailable skill dependencies.

## Observability

Track per skill version: invocation and success/failure counts, tool-call
validity, user correction rate, provider fallback/block rate, token cost, and
regression failures.
